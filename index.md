I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

Great job! Now that GitHub Pages is enabled, you can view your website here: https://jamerbi.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an index file. If an index file is found, GitHub Pages uses the content in the file to create the homepage. If an index file isn’t found, it uses the README.md to create the homepage.

Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

⌨️ Activity: Create your homepage
Navigate to the Code tab of this repository, and browse to the index.md file, or click this link here
In the upper right corner, click the octicon-pencil icon to edit the index.md file
Type the content you want on your homepage. You can also modify title: or just ignore it for now. We'll discuss it later in this course.
